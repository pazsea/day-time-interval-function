  "description": "I wanted to create a function that I could just enter which days and at what range of time during those days a function would run. Also this function would run at that time every week. For example: If I had a store that is open between 10:00 - 15:00 every monday, I would like to run a function that changes from closed paragraph to an open paragraph and vice versa.  So I created this npm package! Hope it works well! Keep on reading to see how you can implement it.",
